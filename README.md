# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Task
- In the ETL_Crowdfunding file, we extracted data from two excel files
  1) crowdfunding.xlsx
  2) contacts.xlsx
-  Within these files we were able to extract information from crowdfunding data files like categories and subcategory dataframes and extract contact information (e.g. names, emails, and contact id) This was then transform through code which is displayed in our ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb.
-  by using the ETL(Extract,Transform, Load) method. CVS files were saved that were used to find relationships with other dataframe tables, which are displayed in our QuickDBD file. Finally we loaded the information into PostgreSQL for a clearer and easier read.

## Methods
- Built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions (regex) to extract and transform the data.
- Use the lambda function in pandas as option B to extract and transfer the data in order to create final cleaned CSV files
- Use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema
